# LSTM-Weather-Forecasting-Rayong
In this experiment, we use the LSTM (Long short-term memory) model from Library Keras to perform weather forecasting. The dataset is taken from the power larc NASA website, which is daily data. The weather will use the area from Rayong Province for a period of 10 years from 2012 - 2022.

There are 5 features in total as follows:
1. Maximum temperature

2. Minimum temperature

3. Windspeed

4. RelativeHumidity

5. Precipitation
